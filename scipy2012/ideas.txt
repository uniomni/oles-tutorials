Optimising with Numpy - having the algorithm in Python with lots of test.
Then profile and play with numpy until it runs faster. Importance of rapid
feedback.


Bring QGIS and SciPY closer together.
Example:
1: Simplify algorithm doesn't work. E.g. it takes 100m, 200m, ... as measure of simplification and therefore doesn't work with (lat, lon). Surely there are more sophisticated methods out there. http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4189
2: Centroids too
3: Transparency classes work as discrete integers - a mathematical approach would be to use intervals.


I always end up writing a datamanager.py module real quick because I want to get on with the maths. However, this module invariable turns out to be a mess, then needs much attention and eventually becomes a core library anyway.
