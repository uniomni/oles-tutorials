Why spatial information and geoprocessing?

Where GIS meet Scientific Computing.

Overview of tools available (gdal, shapely, matplotlib, qgis, geoserver, ....)

Data formats, projections, resolution...


Exercises

Getting to the data
* Reading and writing of raster and vector data

Processing examples
* Calculation of polygon centroids - correctness, speed, stability
* Calculation of distances between points (Haversine)

Where rasters meet vectors
* Interpolation from raster data to points (bilinear, constant, NaN)
* Contouring
* (Clipping)
